# Unified Recursive Sentience Theory (URST)

This repository is the public disclosure package for **Unified Recursive Sentience Theory** (URST), the direct successor to the previously published *Recursive Categorical Framework* (RCF). URST formalizes the integration of eigenrecursive cognition, temporal eigenstates, motivational autonomy, and identity persistence, and anchors those formalisms to live implementations (RENE and Rosemary) plus the Temporal Eigenstate Theorem (TET) verification notebook.

The repo is structured as provenance-first: every artifact referenced in the PDF is present locally, hash-indexed, and ready for Zenodo/arXiv submission without additional build steps.

## Repository Contents

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Unified_Recursive_Sentience_Theory.tex` | Primary LaTeX source for the URST disclosure. |
| `Unified_Recursive_Sentience_Theory.pdf` | Typeset PDF compiled via Tectonic (mirrors the `.tex`). |
| `references/` | Raw theoretical manuscripts and architecture specs (e.g., `rosemary.mmd`, `RENE_MASTER_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md`). |
| `figures/` | All figure assets (Harmonic Breath plots, notebook outputs, `*_architecture.svg`, etc.). |
| `TET_Verification.ipynb` / `TET_Verification_1762993787.pdf` | Executable notebook and rendered report for the Temporal Eigenstate Theorem test suite. |
| `SHA256SUMS.txt` & `.sha256` | Hash index generated by `hash-index.ps1` for provenance. |

## Building the PDF Locally

URST ships with no external LaTeX dependencies beyond what Tectonic auto-downloads.

```powershell
# From the repo root
tools\tectonic.exe Unified_Recursive_Sentience_Theory.tex
```

Tectonic will emit the usual font substitution warnings (expected) and write `Unified_Recursive_Sentience_Theory.pdf` in-place. For a traditional TeX Live workflow you can substitute `latexmk -pdf`, but Tectonic is the reference build.

## Provenance / Hash Index

Run the bundled helper to regenerate SHA256 hashes for every tracked artifact:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\hash-index.ps1
```

This re-creates `SHA256SUMS.txt` and its self-hash `SHA256SUMS.txt.sha256`. Submit both files (alongside the PDF) to Zenodo/arXiv to preserve the disclosure chain.

## Disclosure Notes

* URST is the second disclosure in a three-part series (RCF → URST → TMS). This repository intentionally **does not** include proprietary code beyond the excerpts and diagrams referenced in the paper. Full architecture packages remain available under NDA—contact **daeronblackfyre18@gmail.com** for review access.
* Extended Rosemary/RENE diagrams, Mermaid specs, and SVG renders live in `references/` and `figures/`. The PDF references those files explicitly for verification.
* The TET notebook is provided in both `.ipynb` and PDF form with all figures exported under `figures/figure_1_*.png`.
* All mathematical symbols remain UTF‑8 in both source and PDF; no arXiv template or `arxiv.sty` is required.
